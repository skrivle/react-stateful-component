# React Stateful Component

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vejersele/react-stateful-component.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vejersele/react-stateful-component)

This is work in progress ...

Create stateful React components in a more functional way. Heavily inspired by ReasonReact's api
https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/

Goals:
- flow types
- SideEffect support
- support for lifecycle hooks

Todo:
- SideEffect's
- how to deal with binding unbinding event handlers and timeouts/intervals (no access to instance vars)
